              I am looking for work as a Full Stack Web Developer.
              My background is as a software developer but I have 
              recently started focusing on web development.
              
              I have previous experience developing software in several
              industries including transportation, avionics, tolling,
              database engines and geographic information systems.
              
              I have used C/C++ and Java as implementation languages,
              as well as Perl, Python and PHP as scripting languages.
              
              I am currently taking a full stack development
              course and am thus improving my skills in HTML CSS and
              JavaScript, among other technologies.
              
              I have previous experience working for start-up companies,
              as well as experience as a telecommuter. I have Windows, 
              Linux and OS X systems at home, as well as print/copy/scan/fax
              equipment, I am thus prepared to work remotely on many types
              of jobs.
